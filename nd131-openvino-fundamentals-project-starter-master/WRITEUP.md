# Project Write-Up

This project detects humans in a video stream using different models. The models are Tensor Flow models and are used pre-and post conversion to OpenVino projects.  This projects uses the OpenVino toolkit and is written in python. 

## Explaining Custom Layers

For the process behind converting custom layers for this project, I used extensions that already exist in OpenVino.  The models I used were in the Tensorflow Object Detection Model Zoo.  The extensions are located in eployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf and I found extensions for the two models I used.  

The two models/ extensions I used were: 
sd_inception_v2_coco: ssd_v2_support.json
faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco: faster_rcnn_support.json

The full commands are:

python3 /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28/frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28/pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json

python3 /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28/frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28/pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/faster_rcnn_support.json

Some of the potential reasons for handling custom layers are that they may be new models that have layers that are not understood.  


## Comparing Model Performance

My method(s) to compare models before and after conversion to Intermediate Representations
were to time the process for each run. 

The difference between model accuracy pre- and post-conversion was...

The size of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

The inference time of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

## Assess Model Use Cases

Some of the potential use cases of the people counter app are...

Each of these use cases would be useful because...

## Assess Effects on End User Needs

Lighting, model accuracy, and camera focal length/image size have different effects on a
deployed edge model. The potential effects of each of these are as follows...

## Model Research

[This heading is only required if a suitable model was not found after trying out at least three
different models. However, you may also use this heading to detail how you converted 
a successful model.]

In investigating potential people counter models, I tried each of the following three models:

- Model 1: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
  
- Model 2: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...

- Model 3: [Name]
